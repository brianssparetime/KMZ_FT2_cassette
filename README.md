You can upload the STL files to be be printed by, e.g. CraftCloud.  
Be sure to order two copies, since the STL files only have parts for 
a single canister.

When you get them back, no finishing work is required, other than
lining the inside with adhesive felt or foam.

I recommend taping the two sides together once you load them,
since otherwise they very easily separate.
